- <b>Trends :</b> A trend is defined as a pattern of change. <br>
    - <b>sns.lineplot</b> : Line charts are best to show trends over a period of time, and multiple lines can be used to show trends in more than one group. <br>
    <br>
    <hr>
- <b>Relationship :</b> There are many different chart types that you can use to understand relationships between variables in your data. <br>
    <br>
  - <b>sns.barplot</b> : Bar charts are useful for comparing quantities corresponding to different groups.<br>
    <br>
  - <b>sns.heatmap</b> : Heatmaps can be used to find color-coded patterns in tables of numbers.<br>
    <br>
  - <b>sns.scatterplot</b> : Scatter plots show the relationship between two continuous variables; if color-coded, we can also show the relationship with a third categorical variable.<br>
    <br>
  - <b>sns.regplot</b> : Including a regression line in the scatter plot makes it easier to see any linear relationship between two variables.<br>
    <br>
  - <b>sns.lmplot</b> : This command is useful for drawing multiple regression lines, if the scatter plot contains multiple, color-coded groups.<br>
    <br>
  - <b>sns.swarmplot</b> : Categorical scatter plots show the relationship between a continuous variable and a categorical variable.<br>
    <br>
  - <b>Distribution</b> : We visualize distributions to show the possible values that we can expect to see in a variable, along with how likely they are.<br>
    <br>
  - <b>sns.distplot</b> : Histograms show the distribution of a single numerical variable.<br>
    <br>
  - <b>sns.kdeplot</b> : KDE plots (or 2D KDE plots) show an estimated, smooth distribution of a single numerical variable (or two numerical variables).<br>
    <br>
  - <b>sns.jointplot</b> : This command is useful for simultaneously displaying a 2D KDE plot with the corresponding KDE plots for each individual variable.<br>
